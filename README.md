Introduction

To demonstrate the concepts and syntax of SQL, we will use an Integrated Student 

Information System for a university. The system consists of four tables, which are
described below: These tables form the foundation of the Integrated Student Information 
System and allow us to perform various types of queries, manipulations, updates, and 
generate reports based on the application's requirements.
a. STUDENT table - Each row represents data about a student in the university.
b. FACULTY table - Each row represents data about a faculty member employed by the
university.
c. COURSE table - Each row represents a course being taught during the current term.
d. REGISTRATION table - Each row represents a student course registration. For
example, if astudent is enrolled in three courses, three rows would appear in this table.
